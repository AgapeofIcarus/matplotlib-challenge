For the concept of this project, as a senior data analyst I work for Pymaceuticals. This pharmaceutical company is working with various production lines to craft a treatment for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The company has requested tables and figures be generated for the technical report regarding their primary focus, Capomulin, along with a summary of the results. This will be done by providing:

-Bar plot demonstrating total number of measurements taken for each treatment region throughout the study.

-Pie plot displaying ratio of male and female mice used for the study.

-Generate quartiles demonstrating the final tumor volume for each of the mice involved in the four most promising treatments from the study.

-Line plot for one mouse displaying tumor volume vs. time.

-Scatter plot displaying mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. Add a linear regression model.

-Statement with three observations regarding the displayed data.
